# Notes about configuring Security log auditing

* At an organizational level, you can configure the Security log audit policies with Group Policy or InTune. For standalone machines, you can configure with the Local Security Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`). You can also use PowerShell or Batch scripts with built-in commands such as `auditpol` to configure either standalone machines or use them as startup scripts to configure endpoints at scale.
* You should always enable Security log auditing at the sub-category level (`Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced security audit policy settings > System Audit Policies` in Group Policy) instead of the broad category level as the latter will usually enable too many events and will override any granular settings you made at the sub-category level.
* In this document, I have ommited sub-categories and event IDs that are not actually used or are not needed for monitoring or DFIR investigations. Only the important ones that you should enable are listed here.
* You cannot turn on or off specific event IDs, only sub-categories at the most granular level. This is unfortunate as sometimes there will be a couple of noisy event IDs that you can not disable unless you disable the entire sub-category.
* The number of sigma rules were taken at 2022/09/24. Be aware that even if there are few or no sigma rules for a certain event, it does not mean that the event is not important.

| 4782 | Account Pasword Hash Was Accessed | 0 | Not Yet | Info | Generated on a DC during password migration of an account using the AD Migration Toolkit or attackers trying to access password hashes. Seems to be a rare event. |
| 4793 | Password Policy Checking API Was Called | 0 | Not Yet | Low | Generated during password resets or attackers checking the password policy. Seems to be a rare event. |

### 2.3 Security Group Management

A "security-enabled" group is a group that you can assign access permissions (ACLs). The other type is a Distribution Group, which is "security-disabled" and cannot be assigned access permissions. Since security-enabled groups are most common, we will refer to them simply as "groups". For example, `Local Group Created`, instead of `A security-enabled local group was created.`.

A domain local group is a security or distribution group that can contain universal groups, global groups, other domain local groups from its own domain, and accounts from any domain in the forest. You can give domain local security groups rights and permissions on resources that reside only in the same domain where the domain local group is located.

A global group is a group that can be used in its own domain, in member servers and in workstations of the domain, and in trusting domains. In all those locations, you can give a global group rights and permissions and the global group can become a member of local groups. However, a global group can contain user accounts that are only from its own domain.

A universal group is a security or distribution group that contains users, groups, and computers from any domain in its forest as members. You can give universal security groups rights and permissions on resources in any domain in the forest.

Volume: `Low`

### 3.2 Process Creation

Note: A separate setting needs to be enabled to log command line information which is extremely important. `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Administrative Templates > System > Audit Process Creation > Include command line in process creation events` in Group Policy.

If you do not have Sysmon installed and configured to monitor Process Creation, then you should enable this as about half of Sigma's detection rules rely on process creation with command line options enabled.

Volume: `High`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure` if sysmon is not configured.

### 5.2 Group Membership

Records what group a user belongs to when they log in.
ACSC recommends `Success and Failure` but this is probably not needed if you can easily lookup what groups a user belongs to.
You can also check if a user has administrator privileges with the `4672` Admin Logon event.

### 5.3 Logoff

You can think of the `4634` Logoff event as the logon session ending.
If the user did not initiate the logoff, for example if they just closed their RDP client, was logged off by an Administrator or the session timed out, then the `4647` User Initiated Logoff event will not be recorded.

Volume: `High`

Default settings: `Success`

Recommended settings: `Success`

| Event ID | Description | Sigma Rules | Hayabusa Rules | Level | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

### 6.4 File System

You need to separately configure audit permissions on files and/or folders in order for access to be logged. 
For example, by right-clicking, opening Properties, Security tab, Advanced, Auditing tab and then adding a Principal and what permissions to monitor.
It is recommended only to monitor access to sensitive files as there will be too much noise if too many files are enabled for logging.

Volume: `Depends on SACL rules`

### 6.5 Filtering Platform Connection

Logs when WFP (Windows Filtering Platform) allows or blocks port bindings and network connections.

Volume: `High`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure` if you have enough space and are not monitoring network connections with sysmon. This should cause a high amount of events though.

Notable Sigma rules:

### 6.7 Handle Manipulation

This subcategory needs to be enabled to enable events like `4656`, `4658` and `4661` in other subcategories. It also enables an additional event `4690`, however, this event not useful for investigations. It is recommended to enable this subcategory in order to enable more useful events in other subcategories.

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure` 

| Event ID | Description | Sigma Rules | Hayabusa Rules | Level | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4690 | An attempt was made to duplicate a handle to an object | 0 | No | Info | Not relevant for security. |

### 6.8 Kernel Object

This feature is mainly for kernel developers.
This audits attempts to access the kernel objects, such as mutexes, symbolic links, named pipes, etc... 
Only kernel objects with SACLs generate security audit events. By default, kernel objects will not have SACLS defined so they will not be audited.
You can enable auditing of all kernel objects by enabling `Audit the access of global system objects` (GPO: `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options > Audit the access of global system objects`) which will define SACLS for all kernel objects, however, it is not recommended as you will probably generate too many unneeded events. On Windows 11, access to the lsass process seems to be enabled by default, which is good to monitor.

Volume: `High if auditing access of global object access is enabled`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure` but do not enable `Audit the access of global system objects` as you will generate too many `4663: Object Access` events.

Notable Sigma rules:
* `(4656) (High) Generic Password Dumper Activity on LSASS`
* `(4663) (Med) Suspicious Multiple File Rename Or Delete Occurred`: Detects multiple file rename or delete events occurrence within a specified period of time by a same user (these events may indicate ransomware activity).

### 6.10 Registry

Many attacks and malware use the registry so it is a great place for evidence, however, it is difficult to only log only what is needed for detection and if you enable all registry access globally, there will be extreme volume of events and possible performance degradation.

Volume: `Depends on SACLs`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Set SACLs for only the registry keys that you want to monitor`

Notable Sigma rules:
* `(4656) (High) SAM Registry Hive Handle Request`: Attackers will try to access the SAM registry hive to obtain password hashes.

### 7.5 MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change

Audit MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change determines whether the operating system generates audit events when changes are made to policy rules for the Microsoft Protection Service (MPSSVC.exe).
The Microsoft Protection Service, which is used by Windows Firewall, is an integral part of the computer’s threat protection against malware. The tracked activities include:
* Active policies when the Windows Firewall service starts.
* Changes to Windows Firewall rules.
* Changes to the Windows Firewall exception list.
* Changes to Windows Firewall settings.
* Rules ignored or not applied by the Windows Firewall service.
* Changes to Windows Firewall Group Policy settings.

Changes to firewall rules are important for understanding the security state of the computer and how well it is protected against network attacks.

Volume: `Low`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Unknown. Needs testing.`

## 8. Privilege Use

### 8.1 Non-Sensitive Use Events

Audit Non-Sensitive Privilege Use contains events that show usage of non-sensitive privileges:
* Access Credential Manager as a trusted caller
* Add workstations to domain
* Adjust memory quotas for a process
* Bypass traverse checking
* Change the system time
* Change the time zone
* Create a page file
* Create global objects
* Create permanent shared objects
* Create symbolic links
* Force shutdown from a remote system
* Increase a process working set
* Increase scheduling priority
* Lock pages in memory
* Modify an object label
* Perform volume maintenance tasks
* Profile single process
* Profile system performance
* Remove computer from docking station
* Shut down the system
* Synchronize directory service data

Volume: `Very high`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

| 4673 | A privileged service was called. | 0 | |
| 4674 | An operation was attempted on a privileged object. | 0 | |
| 4985 | The state of a transaction has changed. | 0 | |

> **Note: Non-sensitive and sensitive privilege use events use the same event ID.**

### 8.2 Sensitive Privilege Use

Audit Sensitive Privilege Use contains events that show the usage of sensitive privileges:
* Act as part of the operating system
* Back up files and directories
* Restore files and directories
* Create a token object
* Debug programs
* Enable computer and user accounts to be trusted for delegation
* Generate security audits
* Impersonate a client after authentication
* Load and unload device drivers
* Manage auditing and security log
* Modify firmware environment values
* Replace a process-level token
* Take ownership of files or other objects

The use of two privileges, “Back up files and directories” and “Restore files and directories,” generate events only if the `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Security Options > Audit: Audit the access of global system objects` Group Policy setting is enabled.
However, it is not recommended to enable this Group Policy setting because of the high number of events recorded.

Volume: `High`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure` However, this may be too noisy.

Notable Sigma rules:
* `(4673) (High) User Couldn't Call a Privileged Service 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess'`: The 'LsaRegisterLogonProcess' function verifies that the application making the function call is a logon process by checking that it has the SeTcbPrivilege privilege set. Possible Rubeus tries to get a handle to LSA.
* `(4673) (Med) Suspicious Driver Loaded By User`: Detects the loading of drivers via 'SeLoadDriverPrivilege' required to load or unload a device driver. With this privilege, the user can dynamically load and unload device drivers or other code in to kernel mode. This user right does not apply to Plug and Play device drivers. If you exclude privileged users/admins and processes, which are allowed to do so, you are maybe left with bad programs trying to load malicious kernel drivers. This will detect Ghost-In-The-Logs (https://github.com/bats3c/Ghost-In-The-Logs) and the usage of Sysinternals and various other tools. So you have to work with a whitelist to find the bad stuff.
* `(4674) (Med) SCM Database Privileged Operation`: Detects non-system users performing privileged operation os the SCM database.

This policy setting allows you to audit events related to security system extensions or services such as the following:
* A security system extension, such as an authentication, notification, or security package is loaded and is registered with the Local Security Authority (LSA). It is used to authenticate logon attempts, submit logon requests, and any account or password changes. Examples of security system extensions are Kerberos and NTLM.
* A service is installed and registered with the Service Control Manager. The audit log contains information about the service name, binary, type, start type, and service account.

Volume: `Low, but more on DCs`

Default settings: `No Auditing`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure`

Notable Sigma rules:
* `(4611) (High) Register new Logon Process by Rubeus`: Detects potential use of Rubeus via registered new trusted logon process.
* `(4697) (High) Invoke-Obfuscation Obfuscated IEX Invocation`
* `(4697) (High) Invoke-Obfuscation Via Use Rundll32`
* `(4697) (High) Invoke-Obfuscation Via Use MSHTA`
* `(4697) (High) CobaltStrike Service Installations`
* `(4697) (High) Credential Dumping Tools Service Execution`
* `(4697) (Crit) Malicious Service Installations`
* `(4697) (Crit) Meterpreter or Cobalt Strike Getsystem Service Installation`

| 4610 | An authentication package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority. | 0 | No | ? | According to MS, this should be monitored with an allowlist but this event seems to not be generated.  |
| 4611 | A trusted logon process has been registered with the Local Security Authority. | 1 | Not Yet | Low~High | Should display "SYSTEM" in the "Subject" field. |
| 4614 | A notification package has been loaded by the Security Account Manager. | 0 | No | ? | Seems to be a rare event. |
| 4622 | A security package has been loaded by the Local Security Authority. | 0 | No | ? | Seems to be a rare event. |
| 4697 | A service was installed in the system. | 20 | Yes | Info~High | This is the most important event in this sub-category.　Requires Win 10/2016+. |

### 9.4 System Integrity

Audit System Integrity determines whether the operating system audits events that violate the integrity of the security subsystem:
* Audited events are lost due to a failure of the auditing system.
* A process uses an invalid local procedure call (LPC) port in an attempt to impersonate a client, reply to a client address space, read to a client address space, or write from a client address space.
* A remote procedure call (RPC) integrity violation is detected.
* A code integrity violation with an invalid hash value of an executable file is detected.
* Cryptographic tasks are performed.

According to Microsoft, violations of security subsystem integrity are critical and could indicate a potential security attack.

Volume: `Low`

Default settings: `Sucess, Failure`

Recommended settings: `Success and Failure`

Currently, there are no sigma rules for this sub-category.

## 10. Global Object Access Auditing

You can configure all `File system` and `Registry` access to be recorded here but it is not recommended for production due to the very high amount of logs you will generate.
It is recommended to turn on when simulating attacks to find out what registry and files are changed in order to write detection rules.
